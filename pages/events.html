          <p>
            Tihar Festival in Nepal is, essentially, the equivalent of Deepavali in India and other Hindu lands.
  		In fact, some Nepalese even refer to it as “Deepawali”. Its timing is based on the new moon of the Hindu month Kartika, but extends two days before
  		and after that event. Thus, it is a five-day festival. On the Western calendar, it comes in either November or October, varying year to year.
  		While each Hindu ethnic group in Nepal celebrates Tihar in slightly different ways, the main outlines remain the same everywhere. </br></br>The season is
  		called “the Festival of Lights” after the clay lanterns (“diyas”) that are lit and stacked around houses every night. People use pigmented rice,
  		flour, sand, and flower petals to make “rangoli,” which are decorative patterns on the floors of homes and outdoor areas. They are meant to honor
  		and welcome various Hindu gods and goddesses to the home. Also of high importance is the honoring of various animals during Tihar, which will be
  		mentioned in more detail just below.
